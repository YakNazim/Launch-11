# Roll Control Theory

The first thing we need to do is create a model and validate it on past
launches.

`create_model_data.py` was written to take data from the succesful
[2010 roll control launch](https://github.com/psas/flight_data-2010.10.17)
and find the rocket's airspeed and angular acceleration for the duration of the
flight. These are imputs to the model.
