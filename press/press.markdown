# PSAS L--11 Mission Overview

## Background

The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is an interdisciplinary student aerospace project based in Portland State University's Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer science.

PSAS launches amateur rockets with arguably the world's most sophisticaed amateur avionics (onboard computers, electronics and radios). For more information on PSAS, please see our website at http://psas.pdx.edu/.

## Overview

The  L-11 mission will be the 12th launch in PSAS history. L-11 is scheduled for July 20th, 2014 in Central Oregon, aproximately 40 miles east of Bend. Our rocket will travel to approximately 14,500 ft above the central Oregon desert, radioing back real time video and sensor data from the flight.

L-11 will be the 6th flight for our current rocket airframe, designated **LV2.3** (the third iteration of Launch Vehicle 2). LV2.3 is a test bed for PSAS's ongoing research in open source, amateur rocket avionics. On-board we have a complex, custom built flight computer made
up of dozens of smaller projects. This flight will continue our tradition of incremental testing and pushing the technological boundaries of university-level aerospace projects.

## Background and Purpose

A lot of work has gone into bringing our system up to current state of the art. Since 2010 we have completed an almost complete overhaul of the on-board electronics.

Two flights ago, in 2011,  we had a motor failure due to a bad batch of solid fuel from a commercial vendor. While this only caused minor damage, it meant we didn't fit a successful launch in that year. After fixing the damage we also attempted to upgrade our main flight computer, but this involved many months of work integrating new hardware and delayed our next flight by a whole year.

The last flight in 2013, while mechanically flawless, saw a major electrical fault right at ignition that resulted in a loss of power and data. We were very excited to see the results of our new flight computer framework, but sadly without the data we essentially need to fly the same rocket again this year.

For this flight we expect to show that previous issues have been resolved. If successful it will mark a major milestone for PSAS: not only will it contain the most modern and advanced amateur rocket flight computer---also called avionics---system, but it will set the pace for our future experiments.


## Goals and Experiments

The primary goal of the launch is a shake out of the entire system, including ground based tracking and data capture technologies. Specifically, we will be testing:

- A completely new telemetry system using off-the-shelf WiFi (IEEE 802.11b) technology. All of our data (telemetry) and onboard digital video will be transmitted using this common technology. Instead of going only a few 10s of feet, however, we will be sending the date over 2.5 miles at a speed over Mach 1.
- The half dozen computers on board will communicate over the the first **Ethernet** based data bus on an amateur rocket.
- A new web-based telemetry viewer and control system, which will launch our rocket via a click in a web browser.
- Using the combination of these new technologies, we will re-try our successful 2010 **Roll Control** experiment, where the computer on the rocket will actively stabilize the spin rate of the rocket in flight.

## The Challenge

Rocketry is inherently difficult. There a hundreds of important details from launch to recovery. At PSAS we hope to operate dozens of systems together, from ground tracking equipment, to on-board cameras, to computer software and mechanical systems. Putting everything together and having near perfect coherence between such disparate field of engineering is the challenge of PSAS. Failure is an important part of the learning experience.

# Mission Timeline

_Times and dates are subject to change._

## Where

L-11 will occur outside of Brothers, Oregon, at the Oregon Rocketry (http://www.oregonrocketry.com/)  "Brothers Launch Site" (http://www.oregonrocketry.com/?page_id=78).

## Attending the Launch

If you would like to attend the L-11 launch, please attend one of PSAS' open meetings each Tuesday night, at 7:00pm, in PSU's Fourth Avenue Building, room 84.

## The Launch Weekend

Early Saturday morning PSAS members leave Portland in a loose convoy to drive to the launch site in Central Oregon. We normally arrive at the site in the afternoon and immediately get to work setting up the launch tower, mission control, and our campsite.
