# Drop Tower Tests

Before flying this year we want to verify that cables and connectors are in good
working order. A full vibration and shock test would be preferred. However we
have access to PSU's[Dryden Drop Tower](http://www.ddt.pdx.edu/) which can
produce in excess of 14 g's of braking deceleration for many milliseconds. This
happens to make a good launch shock test environment. Plus it helped get the
group into launch mode, including updating our written procedures and data
pipelines.


## Baseline 0

We started with a baseline measurement after getting the power measuring set up.
